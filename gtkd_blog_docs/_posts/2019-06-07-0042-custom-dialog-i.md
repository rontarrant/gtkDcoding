# 0042: Dialogs VIII - Customizing (1 of 3) - Aesthetics

Today we start a three-part series about building a `Dialog` from scratch.

There's a range of topics to cover, so I’ve split them up like this:

- *Part I* deals with how to create an aesthetically-pleasing widget layout for a custom `Dialog`,
- *Part II* covers user interaction, and
- *Part III* brings it all together.

There are two code example files today and they illustrate before and after states of using design principles.

The first one is...

## Anatomy of a Dialog Window

A custom `Dialog` has two areas you need to deal with:

- the content area, and
- the action area.

It’s not complicated, but besides presenting information and soliciting user interaction, we also have to come up with a way to make everything we stuff into the content area look good. Since the `Table` widget has been deprecated, the easiest way to do this now is with a `Grid`.

But before we get to how the content area is built, I’d like to go over a few basics of how to make an appealing layout. This isn’t only about lining things up, but also keeping them from looking cramped and helping the user's eye see the important stuff.

## A Brief Introduction to Design

*Note: Be advised that when I speak of layout, I’m not talking about the `Layout` `Widget`. I’m talking about the design concept of layout.*

The approach I’ve taken to controlling layout is elementary and easy to implement:

- each widget in a layout is placed in its own `Box`, and
- the boxes are then stuffed into `Grid` squares.

This allows:

- each `Box` to have elbow room, that is: separation from the contents of other `Box`es in the design, and
- column or row justification can be done easily on a column-by-column or row-by-row basis.

Because I learned about design in art college, I feel more comfortable speaking that language when it comes to layout. So I’ve taken the liberty of translating from coder speak to artist speak so you can then take your pick when you're doing your own stuff. Here's what I came up with...

In design terms, alignment is:

- left-justified,
- right-justified, or
- centre-justified.

Anyone who’s used a word processor or desktop publishing application knows these terms, too, so I came up with this `enum`:

```d
enum BoxJustify
{
	LEFT = 0,
	RIGHT = 1,
	CENTER = 2,
	TOP = 3,
	BOTTOM = 4,
	
} // PaBoxJustify
```

This allows us to speak in designerly terms. And by the way, `CENTER` is used for either horizontal or vertical centering.

## Padding vs. Border & Margin

There are at three ways to get extra space around a widget:

- padding,
- border, and
- margin.

And here’s how *GTK* uses them:

- padding controls the space around all four sides of a `Widget` with a single setting,
- border does the same, and
- margin is used to set top, bottom, right and left individually.

Technically, padding is inside the confines of the widget and border is outside, but the effect for our purposes is the same with either. In deciding which to use, I looked at which widgets have each of these:

- the `Widget` and all its sub-classes have margin settings,
- the `Container` and all its sub-classes have border settings, and
- only the `Box` has padding.

That means we can use the border property of any `Container`-derived `Widget` to get the control needed to make a layout look good.

### So what’s the margin for?

One of the things designers discovered eons ago is that having the same amount of space at the top and bottom of a design doesn’t quite look right. A bit of extra space at the bottom makes things feel more balanced. And ‘feel’ is the right word because it’s an optical illusion, but such is the nature of the human mind.

So, here are the guidelines I use:

- set overall spacing with `setBorderWidth()`, and
- use `setMarginBottom()` for that final, aesthetic touch.

Also, this blog tries to be as forward-facing as possible and with *GTK 4.0* deprecating the use of padding, that leaves us with border and margin.

Keep in mind that the border is the space between a `Container` and its parent, so:

- the `Grid`’s border is between itself and the `Dialog`'s *Content Area*, and
- the `Box`’s border is between itself and the `Grid` square(s) containing it.

We don’t need to bother with the spacing between a child widget and its `Box` container (and that's a good thing because most child `Widget`s won't give us that control anyway). Now let’s get into the classes...

## The HPadBox

Here’s the initialization chunk:

```d
class HPadBox : Box
{
	private:
	Widget _widget;
	int _globalPadding = 0;
	int _padding = 0;
	bool fill = false;
	bool expand = false;
	int _borderWidth = 5;

	BoxJustify _pJustify;
```

We still have variables for `_globalPadding` and `_padding`, but they’re both set to `0` so they don’t get in the way... for now. *GTK 4.0* compliance will mean calls to the `Box` constructor will need one less argument, but we'll deal with that when 4.0 is released because for now, we still need them:

- the `Box` constructor still expects global padding, and
- the `packStart()` or `packEnd()` functions expect local padding.

The `_pJustify` variable will be one of the values from the `BoxJustify` enum discussed in *A Lighting-fast Introduction to Design* above.

## The Constructor

Here's the meat-n-taters of this class:

```d
	public:
	this(Widget widget, BoxJustify pJustify)
	{
		_widget = widget;
		_pJustify = pJustify;
		
		super(Orientation.HORIZONTAL, _globalPadding);

		if(_pJustify == BoxJustify.LEFT)
		{
			packStart(_widget, expand, fill, _padding);
		}
		else if(_pJustify == BoxJustify.RIGHT)
		{
			packEnd(_widget, expand, fill, _padding);
		}
		else
		{
			add(_widget);
		}	
		
		setBorderWidth(_borderWidth);

	} // this()
	
} // class HPadBox
```

Because the constructor’s first argument is a `Widget`, it’ll accept whatever widget you wanna drop into it... a `Label`, an `Entry`, whatever. We’ll talk more about that mechanism in a moment, but first let’s finish off this justification stuff...

`Box`es in the latest incarnation of *GTK* are genericized. *GTK 2.x* had an `HBox` and a `VBox`, but now we have the plain ole `Box` and—you’ll recognize this from earlier blog posts—the Box's constructor is passed a directional `Orientation`:

- `Orientation.HORIZONTAL`, or
- `Orientation.VERTICAL`.

And because the `Box` is generic, the orientation changes the meaning of `packStart()` or `packEnd()`:

- with `Orientation.HORIZONTAL`:
	- `packStart()` means left justify, and
	- `packEnd()` means right justify,
- with `Orientation.VERTICAL`:
	- `packStart()` means top justify, and
	- `packEnd()` means bottom justify.

With either `Orientation`, `add()` means center justify.

You can probably guess how this all pans out, but here it is in black-n-white: the `BoxJustify` enum values translate to:

- `Orientation.HORIZONTAL`:
	- `LEFT` = `packStart()`,
	- `RIGHT` = `packEnd()`, or
	- `CENTER` = `add()`,
- `Orientation.VERTICAL`:
	- `TOP` = `packStart()`,
	- `BOTTOM` = `packEnd()`, and
	- `CENTER` = `add()`.

This example doesn't have a `VPadBox`, but you've got the tools now to figure out how that would go together. Now let’s move on to the child widget used with `HPadBox`...

## The HPadLabel

This class is derived from the `HPadBox` class, but not the `Label` class. Instead, the Label becomes a property of the class and is passed to the super-class constructor where it’s treated as a generic, incoming `Widget`. *D* only allows a class to inherit from a single super-class, but this way we can sidestep that limitation and sneak in a second one... sort of:

```d
class HPadLabel : HPadBox
{
	Label label;
	
	this(string text, BoxJustify pJustify)
	{
		label = new Label(text);
		
		super(label, pJustify);
		
	} // this()
	
} // class HPadLabel
```

And that takes care of keeping our widgets separated from each other within our GUI design. Now let’s look at how the entire design fends off border encroachment by the `Window`.

*Note: In case you didn't want to take the implied challenge above...*

*A `VPadBox` can be interpolated from the `HPadBox` by changing the name and switching `LEFT` to `TOP` and `RIGHT` to `BOTTOM`. Then you could derive a whole set of `VPadXxxx` widgets to go with it. And as usual, if you want to discuss any of this, I invite you to respond to one of the* GtkD *threads in the* Learn *section of the* D-lang *forum or start a thread on [GtkD.org](http://gtkd.org) (see the links below).*

## The PadGrid

This is pretty straightforward:

```d
class PadGrid : Grid
{
	private:
	int _borderWidth = 10;
	HPadLabel zeroZero, oneZero, zeroOne, oneOne;
	
	public:
	this()
	{
		super();
		setBorderWidth(_borderWidth);
		setMarginBottom(10);

		// row 0
		zeroZero = new HPadLabel("this is a long bit of text", BoxJustify.RIGHT);
		attach(zeroZero, 0, 0, 1, 1);
		
		oneZero = new HPadLabel("cell 1, 0", BoxJustify.LEFT);
		attach(oneZero, 1, 0, 1, 1);

		// row 1
		zeroOne = new HPadLabel("and this is shorter", BoxJustify.RIGHT);
		attach(zeroOne, 0, 1, 1, 1);
				
		oneOne = new HPadLabel("cell 1, 1", BoxJustify.LEFT);
		attach(oneOne, 1, 1, 1, 1);
		
	} // this()
	
} // class PadGrid
```

The `_borderWidth` variable does the heavy lifting while `setMarginBottom()` adds the aesthetic touch.

Also, in case it isn't obvious, the `HPadLabel`s are named for their positions within the `Grid`.

## Conclusion

And that’s it for this time. Far from being an exhaustive or even comprehensive guide to design and layout, follow these few rules and you’ll at least be headed in the right direction:

- separate each widget from its parent and siblings by stuffing it into a `HPadBox`, `VPadBox`, or something of your own devising. Then use `setBorderWidth()` to give them elbow room,
- stuff each `HPadBox` into a `PadGrid` and separate it from the containing widget (`Window`, Content Area, etc.) with `setBorderWidth()`,
- set up left-, right-, top-, or bottom-alignment with the `BoxJustify` enum, and
- give the `PadGrid` an aesthetic bit of extra space via `setMarginBottom()`.

Neither be stingy nor overzealous with border width or the bottom margin. Use glossy print magazine page layouts as guides to this whole space-around-elements thing.

See you next time for *Part II*.
