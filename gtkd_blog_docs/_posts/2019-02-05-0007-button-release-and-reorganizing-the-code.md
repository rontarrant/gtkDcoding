We’ll be making small but significant changes to the code this time around. The last time we looked at buttons, ([Post 0004](/2019/01/25/0004-oop-button.html)) we built everything from within the `main()` function. Further, we used the `onClicked` signal to get our button to do something.

This time around, we’ll be building the button from within the test rig class so all we have to do in `main()` is create the test rig window and everything else will be done automatically.

## Changes in main()

Take a look at the main function:

```d
void main(string[] args)
{
	Main.init(args);
	TestRigWindow myTestRig = new TestRigWindow();
	
	// give control over to gtkD.
	Main.run();
	
} // main()
```

Previously, the window’s title was defined at the top of `main()` and passed in as a string variable rather than a string. This time, there’s no window title because—in the interests of going full-on OOP—it’s been moved inside the `TestRigWindow` class.

And you may also notice that we don’t even do a `testRigWindow.showAll()` here. It, too, has been moved inside the `TestRigWindow` class.

## Changes in the TestRigWindow Class

And if all you looked at was the `main()` function, you might be led to believe this example didn’t do much. So, now let’s look at the `TestRigWindow` class:

```d
class TestRigWindow : MainWindow
{
	string windowTitle = "Test Rig";
	string departingMessage = "Bye.";
	
	this(/* NO ARGS */)
	{
		// window
		super(windowTitle);
		addOnDestroy(delegate void(Widget w) { quitApp(); } );
		
		// a button that does something
		MyButton myButt = new MyButton(buttonCaption);
		add(myButt);
		
	} // this()
	
	
	void quitApp()
	{
		writeln(departingMessage);
		Main.quit();
		
	} // quitApp()

} // class myAppWindow
```

These changes are all about maximizing OOP-ness and to that end, anything that has to do with a particular object has been moved into the class definition for that object. That's why the missing window title shows up here as class data along with a `partingMessage` variable. Keeping all this where it's easily found is a good habit to get into.

Now the constructor. Previously, all we did in there was call the parent using the `super()` function and then we hooked up the window’s close button. This time around, there are three major changes to the constructor:

- there are no arguments because we’ve stored the window title as class data,
- we've gone back to a syntax for the `addOnDestroy()` function that we used in earlier examples, and
- the button is added here instead of in `main()`.

So now all operations appear in the most appropriate places:

- `main()` encompasses all top-level calls, no more, no less,
- the `TestRigWindow` class contains all data and functions associated with it, no more, no less, and
- (when we get to it) it’s same for the `MyButton` class.

### Different Signal for the Window’s Close Button

We saw this approach to hooking up the close button back in the first blog entry and I talked about it a bit in [blog entry #0001](/2019/01/15/0001-imperative-test-rig.html). It’s used here simply to keep us (me, mostly) from falling into a rut and as a reminder of how using it means defining the callback in a slightly different way. (Hint: look at the `quitApp()` definition with an eye toward counting arguments.)

### Initializing the Button

And of course, the button is created here. Let’s move on.

## The MyButton Class

Here we go:

```d
class MyButton : Button
{
	string buttonText = "My Butt";
	string actionMessage = "Action was taken.";
	
	this()
	{
		super(buttonText);
		addOnButtonRelease(&takeAction);
		
	} // this()
	
	
	bool takeAction(Event event, Widget widget)
	{
		writeln(actionMessage);
		
		return(false);
		
	} // takeAction()
	
} // class MyButton
```

As mentioned above, there’s the data right at the top. And looking at the constructor, there’s a different signal being hooked up here, `onButtonRelease`. It doesn’t seem like that big a change until you look at the callback definition.

The callback now has two arguments, an event and a widget. Remember that widget is the base class for everything from windows to containers to buttons, so what we’re really saying here is: whatever widget-derived entity we happen to be pressing into service.

The event argument gives us access to a bunch of interesting stuff, but since the word count is already getting up there, we’ll talk about that in a later post. For now, just know there’s more than one signal we can handle with a callback and if we need access to the raw event that triggers the callback, that’ll be possible, too.

## Conclusion

Here we are at the end of another post. We covered a few interesting things here like reorganizing the code in a full-blown OOP style, hooking up a new signal, and reorganizing the code. Now I realize that points one and three are the same, but they're so important, I mentioned them twice (paraphrasing a joke from Red Dwarf).

And that’s all for now. Be with them widgets and happy D-coding.
