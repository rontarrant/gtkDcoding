# 0085: Nodes-n-noodles, Part IV – Drawing a Node

Last time we visited this series, we drew a noodle using the mouse. Now, we turn to the node stuff. But before we dive in, I’d like to outline how this nodes-n-noodles concept is going to play out, widget-wise.

## Of What Does a Node Consist?

Back in 2006, I wrote an application in *PHP-GTK2* called *Corkboard*. It was an index card simulator in which the user could create/remove cards, move them around on a corkboard, edit them... all that happy stuff. In that case, the index cards were `Button` widgets with multi-line `Label`s embedded. The entire card was ‘hot’ (reacted to mouse clicks) and changed color so the user would know which one was selected.

<div class="inpage-frame">
	<figure class="right">
		<img src="/images/diagrams/023_nodes/node.png" alt="Figure 1: A Look Back at the Node Design" style="width: 111px; height: 102px;">
		<figcaption>
			Figure 1: A Look at<BR> the Node Design
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

Using a `Button` was appropriate for *Corkboard* because an index card is rectangular and, well... so is a `Button`. But for nodes-n-noodles, a rectangle doesn’t quit do it. Going by what other applications are doing with this type of thing, we need a rectangular-ish widget, but with terminals sticking out the sides and, what the heck, let’s give the node rounded corners for that 1950s refrigerator look. The drawing to the right is the end result we're aiming for.

I tried to produce the node using an `Image` on a `Button`, but getting rid of the `Button`’s rectangular border is far more trouble than it's worth. And leaving it there spoiled the look. So instead, I used a `DrawingArea`.

Yup, that’s right. A `DrawingArea`—because it’s a full-fledged `Widget`—can do just about anything a `Button` can do. And if it doesn’t, you can expand its capabilities by adding more signal flags. And best of all, the final look of the node can be whatever shape suits the job at hand.

## A Working Surface

In that long-ago version of *Corkboard*, I used a `Layout` as the corkboard. The advantages to using a `Layout` are:

- child widgets can be `put()` in specific places rather than being at the mercy of widget flow as they would be in—for instance—the `Box` widget,
- the `Layout` inherits from `ScrollableIT`, so scrolling is part of its default functionality, and
- widgets can be layered onto a `Layout`, so it’s easy to have a backdrop behind whatever foreground widgets you wanna stick in there.

And, since the goal for nodes-n-noodles is more or less the same as it was for *Corkboard*, the `Layout` will suit quit well.

All right, we’ve got our widget players, let’s bring them onstage. We’re going to have a `Layout` and on that `Layout`, we’ll have a `Node`. And since it’ll eventually be moveable, let’s call the class `MoveableNode`... something like this:

```d
class MoveableNode : DrawingArea
{
	private:
	Surface _surface;
	string _imageFilename = "images/node.png";
	int _xOffset = 0, _yOffset = 0, _width, _height;
	GtkAllocation _size;
	
	public:	
	this()
	{
		_surface = ImageSurface.createFromPng(_imageFilename);
		Pixbuf.getFileInfo(_imageFilename, _width, _height); // get the image size

		addOnDraw(&onDraw);
		addOnButtonPress(&doSomething);
		addOnButtonRelease(&doSomethingElse);
		
	} // this()
	
	
	bool onDraw(Scoped!Context context, Widget w)
	{
		context.setSourceSurface(_surface, _xOffset, _yOffset);
		getAllocation(_size);
		setSizeRequest(_width, _height);

		context.paint();
		
		return(true);
		
	} // onDraw()


	bool doSomething(Event e, Widget w)
	{
		writeln("down");
	
		return(true);
		
	} // doSomething()


	bool doSomethingElse(Event e, Widget w)
	{
		writeln("up");
	
		return(true);
		
	} // doSomethingElse()
	
} // class MoveableNode
```

Looking at the class preamble, you’ll notice the visualness of the `Node` is just an image we’re pulling in from a file.

And in the constructor, we use the image file to create a `Surface` and a `Pixbuf`. This is exactly what we did in one of the *Cairo* examples when we [loaded and displayed a PNG](https://github.com/rontarrant/gtkDcoding/blob/master/018_cairo/cairo_018_17_display_png.d).

As usual, the `onDraw()` function takes care of refresh so the drawing always looks the way it should.

For now, the `addOnButtonPress()` and `addOnButtonRelease()` callback functions are just placeholders. We’ll do something with those as we dig deeper into all this.

### The NodeLayout

As mentioned, the surface where the `MoveableNode` lives is based on a `Layout` and looks like this:

```d
class NodeLayout : Layout
{
	MoveableNode moveableNode;
	
	this()
	{
		super(null, null);
		setSizeRequest(640, 360); // has to be set so signals get through from child widgets
		
		moveableNode = new MoveableNode();
		put(moveableNode, 20, 140);		
		
	} // this()
	
} // class NodeLayout
```

Because this is a simple demo with only one `MoveableNode`, it’s hard-coded. Later, we’ll get to a point where hard-coding goes out the window and we do as we did for `Notebook` tabs, creating and deleting `MoveableNodes` on the fly. But for now, this’ll do to illustrate the process so far.

## Conclusion

And that, my friends, is all for this time. Next time, we’ll double back and look at the drawing code that created that node image because we might not want to rely on an image file external to our code on release day. And after we look at the code, we’ll dig into setting up draggable hot-spots and other such stuff.

See you next time.
