Today let’s look at an example that can perhaps be adapted for everyday use.

Herein we set a bit of data with our `RadioMenuItem`s and track it with an observed object. And when the application terminates, it spits out a report about the state of all options in the set. This example is patterned after [the second CheckMenuItem example from two posts ago](https://github.com/rontarrant/gtkDcoding/blob/master/012_menus/menu_012_10_multiple_checkmenuitems.d), so a lot of this ground [was covered there](/2019/04/19/0028-checkmenuitems.html).

Just a quick reminder (if you aren’t flipping back to the previous post) that we created an observed object in `TestRigWindow` which got handed down through the hierarchy. We do the same here, but because we're dealing with `RadioMenuItem`s and not `CheckMenuItem`s, there will be a different approach.

The differences are in:

- how the `FileMenu` adds items,
- where features are turned on or off during signal-handling/callback, and
- (of course) we have mutual exclusivity here which we didn’t in the `CheckMenuItem` example.

Let’s go through them...

## A Busier FileMenu Class

Most of the differences (compared to the `CheckMenuItem` example) are in the constructor. But there are differences throughout, so let’s look at this thing in chunks:

### Chunk #1

```d
class FileMenu : Menu
{
	FeatureRadioMenuItem[] featureItemArray;
	FeatureRadioMenuItem featureItem;
	ExitItem exitItem;
	
	ListSG group;
```

- Instead of giving each item it’s own name here, we’re creating an array (naming is deferred and we'll see that in a moment),
- the `featureItem` string will serve as a temporary name within the `foreach` loop used to create the items, and
- `group` is declared here, but will be defined during creation of the first item.

### Chunk #2

```d
this(ObservedFeaturesList extObservedList)
{
	super();

	foreach(itemName; extObservedList.featureNames)
	{
		if(itemName == extObservedList.featureNames[0])
		{
			featureItem = new FeatureRadioMenuItem(group, extObservedList, itemName);
			group = featureItem.getGroup();
		}
		else
		{
			featureItem = new FeatureRadioMenuItem(group, extObservedList, itemName);
		}

		featureItemArray ~= featureItem;
		append(featureItem);
	}
```

This is the first part of the constructor and includes the `foreach` loop used to create the `RadioMenuItem`s. We step through the `featureNames` string array (a part of the `ObservedFeatureList` object) to get label text for each item. The strings in `featureNames` decide the item names, and the number of strings decides how many items will be in the set.

- the `if` statement takes care of the first item, the one that also defines the `group` variable,
- note that even though we pass the group variable to the RadioMenuItem constructor, it comes back as `null` and only takes on a value when `group = featureItem.getGroup()` is executed,
- the `else` statement passes the now-defined `group` along to all other items as they’re created so they become a set, and
- at the end of the `foreach`, we concatenate the item into our array of items before appending it to the `FileMenu`.

### Chunk #3

```d
		extObservedList.setFeatureDefault();
		
		foreach(item; featureItemArray)
		{
			if(item.getLabel() == extObservedList.getDefaultFeature())
			{
				item.setActive(true);
			}
			else
			{
				item.setActive(false);
			}
		}

		exitItem = new ExitItem(extObservedList);
		append(exitItem);
		
	} // this()
	
} // class FileMenu
```

This part is where we set the default item and make sure the states of all items in `ObservedFeaturesList` agree with the `RadioMenuItem` set.

Since these things take place in the `ObservedFeaturesList` class, we’ll cover them when we get there.

Finally, we drop the `ExitItem` onto the end of the menu and bail:

```d
exitItem = new ExitItem(extObservedList);
append(exitItem);
		
} // this()
```

Now let’s look at...

## Mutual Exclusion in the ObservedFeaturesList Class

Again, we’ll look at this in chunks...

### Chunk #1

```d
class ObservedFeaturesList
{
	bool[string] features;
	string[] featureNames;
	string defaultFeatureName;
```

These variables are:

- `features` : an associative array with Boolean flags for tracking which item is active; text strings used as item names double as keys in the key/value pairs,
- `featureNames` : an array of strings used to name the `RadioMenuItem`s; they do double duty when building the `features` associative array, and
- `defaultFeatureName` : this string needs to match one of those in `featureNames` and is used to set the default item on startup.

### Chunk #2

```d
this()
{
	defaultFeatureName = "Large";
	featureNames = ["Small", "Medium", "Large", "Extra Large"];
	
} // this()
```

Earlier I mentioned that the naming of `RadioMenuItem`s is deferred. Well, this is where it's done. All we do in the constructor is define which item will be the default and then fill in the array naming all the `RadioMenuItem`s in the set. This list can be extended or truncated to change the number of items in the set.

*Note: Don't forget to double-check that `defaultFeatureName` appears verbatim in the `featureNames` array.*

### Chunk #3

```d
void setFeatureDefault()
{
	foreach(ulong i; 0..featureNames.length)
	{
		string featureName = featureNames[i];
		
		if(featureName == defaultFeatureName)
		{
			features[featureName] = true;
		}
		else
		{
			features[featureName] = false;
		}
	}

} // setFeatureDefault()
```

This is the function called from `FileMenu`’s constructor, the one that—as the name implies—sorts out which `RadioMenuItem` will be turned on by default.

Note: I just wanna point out the *D*-ness of the `foreach()` construct. A number of languages use `foreach()` for looping, but *D*'s syntax—if you've never seen it before—is worth a pause to take it in. It breaks down as:

`foreach(`<type> <increment>`;` <start-of-range>`..`<end-of-range>`)`

If you were to write the above loop with `for()`, your incrementing variable would be an integer. But with `foreach()`, any time you increment along the length of an array, `i` has to be a `ulong`.

### Chunk #4

```d
void setFeature(string featureName)
{
	foreach(feature, state; features)
	{
		if(feature == featureName)
		{
			features[feature] = true;
		}
		else
		{
			features[feature] = false;
		}
	}
	
} // setFeature()
```

When an item in the set is selected by the user, this function is called by the callback to keep the `ObservedFeaturesList` in sync with the state of the `RadioMenuItem` set.

### Chunk #5

```d
	string getDefaultFeature()
	{
		return(defaultFeatureName);
	}	
	
	
	bool getFeature(string featureName)
	{
		return(features[featureName]);
		
	} // getFeature()
	
	
	void listFeatures()
	{
		foreach(name, feature; features)
		{
			writeln(name, " = ", feature);
		}
		
	} // listFeatures()
	
} // class ObservedFeaturesList
```

These functions do the following:

- `getDefaultFeature() `is called from the second half of `FileMenu`’s constructor to sync up the flags in the `features` associative array with the state of the `RadioMenuItem` set, and
- `getFeatureState()` is unused in this example, but is here as a placeholder. It returns the Boolean value of the named feature. It can be tested like this (perhaps from somewhere near the end of the `setFeature()` function):

```d
writeln("The state of ", featureName, ": ", getFeatureState(featureName));
```

## And Finally: the FeatureRadioMenuItem Class

This is a lot of stuff we’ve seen before, but one thing I’d like to point out is this: The callback is triggered whether the `RadioMenuItem` is going into an *on* state or an *off* state. That’s why there’s also an `if` statement in there to test the state of the `RadioMenuItem`. I would assume you could also have an `else` for doing some type of clean-up or what-have-you when an item is deselected.

```d
class FeatureRadioMenuItem : RadioMenuItem
{
	string labelText;
	ObservedFeaturesList observedList;
   
	this(ListSG group, ObservedFeaturesList extObservedList, string extLabelText)
	{
		labelText = extLabelText;
		super(group, labelText);

		observedList = extObservedList;
		addOnToggled(&toggleFeature);
		
	} // this()
	
	
	void toggleFeature(CheckMenuItem mi)
	{
		if(getActive() == true)
		{
			observedList.setFeature(labelText);
		}
		
	} // toggleFeature()
	
} // class FeatureRadioMenuItem
```

We could also have used the `onActivate` signal instead of `onToggled`, but the results are pretty much the same either way.

Now, since this looks to be the longest blog post I've done to date, pay no attention while I beat a hasty exit, stage right.
